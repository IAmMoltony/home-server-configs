# home server configs

ok so i have a home server (my laptop) running lighttpd and these are the configs for it

incase i lose them

moltony-chan.moe is the domain name i set in my /etc/hosts file so that i dont have to type

the ip address manually

## setting up

1. lighttpd.conf goes into the conf folder
2. copy stuff in htdocs to htdocs
3. either create the files folder in htdocs if ur insane or make it asymlink to like d:/files idk
